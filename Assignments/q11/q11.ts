   //Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, 
   //print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person,
   //but personalized with their name.

   let nicknames: string[] = ["Anas", "Hamza", "Abdullah"];
   for(let i of nicknames)

      console.log(`Hello ${i}, would you like to learn some typescript today?`);
